        <h2>How I structured this project</h2>
        <p>I first began this project by looking through the project description and text. I looked at the key requirements and descriptions. I quickly noted that we were to create four individual pages in a cohesive way. 
            I then looked at sites for professional organizations similar to the United Nation's website.
        </p>
        <p>After defining the overall feel of the site, I went on to prototyping and creating the intial boilerplate and layout of the pages. I started with the index or landing page and went on to create the game page along with the engage and about pages respectively.</p>
        <p>There are several key elements that can be broken up into four overall sections for the layout of the pages. The navigation element, main body and content element, the footer, and the disclaimer at the bottom of the page. These four elements are repeated throughout the website and commits the website as a whole.</p>
        <h2>Inspiration and Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>For the visual hierarchy I first examined sites for professional organizations similar to the United Nations</p>
        <p>I looked at sites such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/">United Nations</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organization</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders (MSF)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>From these sites I was able to define a professional looking feel for what my particular website would look like. I wanted the main visual impact to be simplicity alongside practicality. I wanted the site to be easy to look at, easy to understand and easy to navigate.</p>
        <p>I chose the typeface Roboto as it was the typeface used for the United Nation's website and was recommended to follow along with the similar sans-serif typeface.</p>
