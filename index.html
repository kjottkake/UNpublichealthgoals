        <h2>Ensuring healthy lives</h2>
        <p>Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is essential to sustainable development. Currently, the
        world is facing a global health crisis unlike any other — COVID-19 is spreading human suffering, destabilizing the
        global economy and upending the lives of billions of people around the globe.</p>

        <h2>Before the pandemic</h2>
        <p>
        Before the pandemic, major progress was made in improving the health of millions of people. Significant strides were
        made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with child and maternal mortality.
        But more efforts are needed to fully eradicate a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and
        emerging health issues. By focusing on providing more efficient funding of health systems, improved sanitation and
        hygiene, and increased access to physicians, significant progress can be made in helping to save the lives of millions.
        </p>

        <h2>Health emergencies such as COVID-19</h2>
        <p>
        Health emergencies such as COVID-19 pose a global risk and have shown the critical need for preparedness. The United
        Nations Development Programme highlighted huge disparities in countries’ abilities to cope with and recover from the
        COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic provides a watershed moment for health emergency preparedness and for investment in
        critical 21st century public services.
